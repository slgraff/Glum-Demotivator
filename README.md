# Glum-Demotivator
What's the matter bunky? The stresses and strains of life got you down? It could be worse; you could be Glum! Listen to Glum utter outrageously negative sayings, and realize just how silly your own self-doubts and fears really are.

Currently plays "We're doomed!" sound utterred by character Glum in the classic Hanna-Barbera cartoon 'The Adventures of Gulliver'.

Future versions will include additional sound clips including "It will never work!", "It's probably a trap" and even more nuggets of wisdom from the most pesimistic cartoon character to ever light the TV screen.
